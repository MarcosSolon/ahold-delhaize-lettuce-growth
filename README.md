### Lettuce Growth Analysis for Ahold Delhaize  

**Author:** Marcos Solon  
**Project period:** October 2025  
**Organization:** Ahold Delhaize  

---

## 📖 Overview  
This project analyzes lettuce growth data to identify environmental factors that influence cultivation time and freshness.  
The study aims to support Ahold Delhaize’s strategic goals in optimizing its **fresh produce supply chain**, ensuring **quality, sustainability, and operational efficiency** across all stages, from cultivation to store delivery.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Understand how **temperature**, **humidity**, **TDS**, and **pH** affect lettuce growth.  
- Determine optimal conditions to improve harvest timing and product freshness.  
- Provide actionable insights through a **BI dashboard** and an **executive report** aligned with Ahold Delhaize’s sustainability and innovation values.  

---

## 💡 Methodology  
The project follows a structured **data analysis workflow**, guided by the **SMART framework** and a **Scope of Work (SOW)**.  

**Key steps:**  
1. Data cleaning and preparation (unit conversion, normalization, derived variables).  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with statistical summaries and visualizations.  
3. Insight generation based on SMART analytical questions.  
4. Development of visual deliverables: executive report (PDF) and BI dashboard.  
5. Visual branding aligned with Ahold Delhaize’s design principles.
